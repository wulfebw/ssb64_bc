# Super Smash Bros. 64 Behavioral Cloning
This repo contains code for training a SSB64 ai agent using behavioral cloning (supervised, imitation learning), which includes:
1. Collecting behavioral cloning data (image-action trajectories) from gameplay
2. Formatting those trajectories as training examples (in various action formats and for use with feed-forward and recurrent networks)
3. Training models on the formatted datasets (feed-forward and recurrent)
4. Deploying the trained models to play (only against the game ai implemented for now)

## Demo
The network controls blue DK in the following clip.
